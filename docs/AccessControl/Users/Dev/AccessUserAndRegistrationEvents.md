# Access, User and Registration events

There are MANY events in the `Zikula\UsersModule\Events\` directory related to User management.
Because there are so many, they are not documented here. Please see the respective classes for further information.

- Events concerning login/logout/authentication
- Events concerning user registration
- Events concerning user account creation/display/manipulation.

In addition, Hooks are used extensively within the UsersModule. There are also 'hook-like' events that are used
within the UsersModule.
