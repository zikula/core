# Translation

Labels and link titles of menu items are automatically translated.
For dynamic menus you need to manually add these messages to your translation catalogue though.
For menus which are created programmatically this is done automatically by translation extractors (see [this doc](../Translation/Usage.md#automatic-translations) for further information).
