# Dynamic menus

A Dynamic menu is a menu that is created via the User Interface in the MenuModule. There is 
great flexibility with this system, such that menu of any type can be created and placed in your
site anywhere you choose. This is enabled by the implementation of the
[KnpMenuBundle](https://symfony.com/doc/master/bundles/KnpMenuBundle/index.html). Please note, 
KnpMenuBundle is already fully included, installed and configured. There is no need to take these
steps as outlined in the docs.

Please see [this tutorial](../Admin/Menus.md) on creating a sample menu and adding it to the site
using a block.
