# Debugging Twig templates

If you need help working with Twig you can install [twig-inspector](https://github.com/oroinc/twig-inspector) which is a nice and powerful tool for inspecting and debugging Twig templates.

Note that by default template files are opened inside your browser. If you want to be able to open them in your IDE or editor instead you need to configure this in `/config/packages/dev/framework.yaml`.  
For more information about the `framework.ide` setting please refer to [Symfony docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#ide).
