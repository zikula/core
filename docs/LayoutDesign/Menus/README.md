# Menu system

## Basic topics

- [Custom menu templates](CustomTemplates.md)

## For developers

Menus are enabled by the implementation of the [KnpMenuBundle](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/KnpMenuBundle/index.html).
It is already fully included, installed and configured - so there is no need
to take these steps as outlined in the docs.

- [ExtensionMenu](Dev/ExtensionMenu.md)
- [Hard coded menus](Dev/HardCodedMenus.md)
