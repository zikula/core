# Conventions

## Service names

Zikula Core uses classes for service definitions where appropriate. Otherwise service names must adhere to this naming scheme.

```
zikula_core.internal.service_name
zikula_core.legacy.service_name
zikula_core.common.service_name
```

All extensions must prefix their service names with the full extension name, replacing camel-case with underscores.

```
vendor_extensionname_module.service_name
```

For example:

```
zikula_search_module.front_controller_listener
```

## Dependency Management

Extensions are responsible to provide/include their own dependencies or create companion modules/bundles to do so.

## Translation Provision Responsibility

### Core

The core will be released with only English. Translations will be provided as secondary downloads.

### Third Party Extensions

Third party extensions should endeavor to include all available translations within their release. A quick release 
cycle should be used in order to quickly make available new translations and small bug fixes as they become available. 
While a contributor may make an extension translation available as an additional download, this is discouraged and 
should be included in the main package as soon as the next release.
