Introduction
------------

Zikula Core is a web based application framework, fully extensible by modules, plugins and themes.

Requirements
------------
Before installing Zikula it's important to ensure that the hosting server environment meets the requirements
of the new core release. Zikula Core 1.4.x has the following requirements:

|               | Minimum       | Recommended  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----------:|
| PHP           | 5.4.1         | 5.5          |


Please note:

 - Zikula requires `AllowOverride All` and the `mod_rewrite` module (be aware the Apache 2.3.9+ has changed
   the default setting for `AllowOverride` to `None`.
 - Additional (advanced) server considerations can be found on
   [the Symfony site](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/configuration/web_server_configuration.html)
 - Zikula requires more memory than typical to install. You should set your memory limit in `php.ini` to 128 MB for the
   installation process.

Before installing
-----------------

Zikula makes use of [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage and download all dependencies.
If cloning via github, composer must be run prior to installation. Run:

    `composer self-update`
    `composer install`

If you store Composer in the root of the Zikula Core checkout, please rename it from `composer.phar` to `composer`
to avoid your IDE reading the package contents.

Installing
----------
Once all of the pre-install steps are complete, choose an installation method:

  1) CLI install: `cd` to zikula root and run `php app/console zikula:install:start`
  2) HTTP install: Run `http://yoursiteurl/install` and follow any on-screen prompts.

<a name="vagrant"></a>
Vagrant installation
--------------------
You can use vagrant to easily setup a complete Zikula development environment.
All you need to do is install [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) and
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). Then run `vagrant up` inside the
cloned repository and wait for the machine to boot (first time booting might
take several minutes). Then head over to `localhost:8080` and install Zikula.
Database user, password and table are all set to `zikula`. PHPMyAdmin is
accessible from `localhost:8081`.
