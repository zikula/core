Requirements
------------
Before installing Zikula it's important to ensure that the hosting server environment
meets the requirements of the new core release. Zikula Core 1.4.0 has the following 
requirements

|               | Minimum       | Recommended  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----------:|
| PHP           | 5.3.3         | 5.5          |


Please note that PHP versions before 5.3.8 are known to be buggy and might not
work for you:

  - before PHP 5.3.4, if you get "Notice: Trying to get property of
    non-object", you've hit a known PHP bug (see
    https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=52083 and
    https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50027);

  - before PHP 5.3.8, if you get an error involving annotations, you've hit
    a known PHP bug (see https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=55156).

  - PHP 5.3.16 has a major bug in the Reflection subsystem and is not 
    suitable to run Zikula (https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=62715)

Zikula requires more memory than typical to install. You should set your memory limit in `php.ini` to 128 MB for the
installation process.

Before installing
-----------------

Zikula makes use of [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage and download
all dependencies. Composer must be run prior to installing a site using Zikula.
Run `composer self-update && composer update`. 

If you store Composer in the root of the Zikula Core checkout, please
rename it from `composer.phar` to `composer` to avoid your IDE reading
the package contents.
