REQUIREMENTS
------------
Linux command line.
PHP CLI version (on Debian/Ubuntu you need #apt-get install php-cli)

PURPOSE
-------
These scripts are designed as a quick way to convert much of your module API use
to Zikula 1.3.0.  It is not designed to refactor modules, just to quickly and
accurately convert templates and rename APIs which would otherwise be a time
consuming task.

Conversion of modules to OO standards can be done quickly and efficiently with
manual search and replace within minutes.

These scripts will:-
a. Convert all templates to use new delimiters, taking care of special requirements
   inside <script> or <style> blocks.
b. Remove the prefix from template plugin calls.
c. Rename all deprecated APIs to new equivalents.

Note if you use 'browser hacks' these must be manually corrected with the
new {browserhack} plugin.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Drop all files to zikula root folder.
2. chmod 755 replace.sh

Example usage from inside Zikula root.
