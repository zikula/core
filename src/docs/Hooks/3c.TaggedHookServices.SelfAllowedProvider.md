HookSelfAllowedProviderInterface
--------------------------------

interface: `\Zikula\Bundle\HookBundle\HookSelfAllowedProviderInterface`

extends: `\Zikula\Bundle\HookBundle\HookProviderInterface`

The `HookSelfAllowedProviderInterface` is an empty interface that is used to identify the class to the HookCollector
service as a special HookProvider that is allowed to hook to its own `HookSubscribers`. No special implementation is
required, but care should be taken when utilizing this feature. Logic should be implemented within the `Provider` to
avoid circular references. Because the `areaId` is available for reference within the `Hook`, this value should be
confirmed before amending content or taking other potentially recursive actions.
