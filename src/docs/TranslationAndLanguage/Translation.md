# Zikula translation

Zikula translation *is* Symfony translation, with some added bonus features. Please refer to 
https://symfony.com/doc/current/translation.html for more information about Symfony features.

**Paths and file names used by the Symfony Translator**

    `app/Resources/translations/<domain>.<locale>.<loader>`
    
    e.g.
    
    `app/Resources/translations/zikula.en.po`

Note: BOTH are loaded and the legacy overwrites the symfony/Core-2.0 type values if the keys are the same in the same
domain because it is loaded second.
Using a *partial* overwrite is possible if you only define the keys you wish to overwrite.

**Paths and file names used by Symfony Translator - bundles (modules, themes etc.)**

    `.../Resources/translations/<domain>.<locale>.<loader>` where domain is `modulebundlename` or `themebundlename`

## Symfony Translator Loaders

Symfony comes with standard file format loaders:
 * ArrayLoader - to load catalogs from PHP arrays.
 * CsvFileLoader - to load catalogs from CSV files.
 * IcuDatFileLoader - to load catalogs from resource bundles.
 * IcuResFileLoader - to load catalogs from resource bundles.
 * IniFileLoader - to load catalogs from INI files.
 * JsonFileLoader - to load catalogs from JSON files.
 * MoFileLoader - to load catalogs from gettext files.
 * PhpFileLoader - to load catalogs from PHP files.
 * PoFileLoader - to load catalogs from gettext files.
 * QtFileLoader - to load catalogs from QT XML files.
 * XliffFileLoader - to load catalogs from Xliff files.
 * YamlFileLoader - to load catalogs from Yaml files.

## Important notes

From Symfony translator documentation
> Each time you create a new translation resource (or install a bundle that includes a translation resource), be sure to
clear your cache so that Symfony can discover the new translation resources.

Translations are cached in `app/cache/<env>/translations/catalogue.<locale>.<key>`

### Fallback locale
There is something new in Symfony translator that was not available with legacy mode.
Let's look at a website with 3 languages: `en` (strings are in `en`), `de` and `pl`.
All languages are enabled but some translations are missing for some strings.

Normally it would show English as default because strings are in English.
The fallback locale is a feature that reads translator 'fallback' setting from config.yaml
and sets this as locale to show instead the one that is missing.
So when viewing a German site in Polish language and Polish translations are not complete
while the German is, it will show German translations instead. This will happen only
when translator fallback setting locale is set to `de`. At the end there is always an English string.
