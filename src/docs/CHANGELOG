Users Module
------------

There has been a significant overhaul of Users module:

  - Admin can now resend a verification e-mail for a pending registration.

  - Admin can now send a password reset e-mail to a user.

  - Improved password recovery workflow. (issue #1631).

  - Added user name recovery. (issue #243).

  - Removed old Authentication API.

  - Changed old password checker js sytem to "passwordchecker" library (issue #1841).

  - Introduced new Authentication API capable of dealing with modern
authentication (login) methods.

  - The Users module configuration variable 'changepassword', which
indicated that the Users module did not manage an account's password, has
been deprecated. To provide alternate management, override the appropriate
template(s) and/or function(s). To provide full authentication services,
implement the Authentication API in a module.

  - The mechanics of the authentication (login) process have changed, and
the templates and functions have been updated accordingly. Templates that override the standard templates used for the login process will need to be
updated, or removed.

  - Added the ability to register a new account that is associated with an
authentication method other than a username and password (Users module
authentication).

  - The mechanics of the registration process have changed, and the
templates and functions have been updated accordingly. Templates that
override the standard templates used for the login process will need to be
updated, or removed.

  - Several functions throughout the Users module have been either
deprecated or removed entirely, in order to support the new log-in and
registration paradigms. Customizations at the function level must be
updated accordingly.

  - Elements of the Legal module that were found in the Users module have
been removed, and their functionality replaced with hooks or events. The
age-check during registration has moved to the Legal module.

  - Removed MD5 as a valid hash method for user passwords.

  - Permission checks in the Users module were made more consistent
throughout (issue #1872).

  - All e-mail messages sent by the Users module can now be
multi-part/alternative messages, containing both a plain-text version and
an HTML version of the message. Templates for both are provided and
automatically used if present.

  - The subject line of all e-mail messages sent by the Users module can now be set from within the e-mail message template. See the templates provided for examples. If multi-part/alternative messages are to be sent, the subject from the HTML version of the message is used (however, the subject should not use HTML).

  - The template file names for all e-mail messages sent from the Users
module have changed. If a site upgrading from 1.2 has created custom
templates for these messages, they should be converted to the new names,
and the ability to send multi-part/alternative messages should be
accounted for.

  - If an attempt is made to log into an account that is pending
registration (either because it is awaiting approval, or is awaiting
verification, or both), the site admin can elect to display that status to
the user in the error message on log-in failure.

  - If an attempt is made to log into an account that is inactive (either
because or is awaiting legacy activation, or because the admin set that
activated state for the user), the site admin can elect to display that
status to the user in the error message on log-in failure.

  - The password recovery work flow has been improved to be clearer to the
user.

  - The new account registration process now collects a password reminder,
and displays this reminder to the user as part of the password recovery
process. For existing sites upgrading to 1.3, existing users will be asked
for a password reminder when they change their password.

  - The option to have the system generate a password and send it to a newly
registering user has been removed as a verification option. Sites
upgrading to 1.3 who have this option set will find this option changed to
verification with a user-selected password.

  - Except in one case, passwords are no longer sent via e-mail to newly
registering users. The one exception is when an admin creates a user
account, sets a password for that account himself, and specifically elects
to send the password via e-mail.

  - Confirmation or verification codes for registration verification,
verification of change of e-mail address, and for password reset requests
all now use the same mechanism and are handled consistently.

  - Requests to change e-mail addresses that go unverified can be set to
expire and be removed a specified number of days after the request is
made.

  - Requests to register a new account where e-mail address verification is required can be set to expire and be removed a specified number of days
after the e-mail verification message is sent. Registrations whose e-mail
verification expires will be removed from the system. Registrations
awaiting approval will not expire until after they are approved.

  - If the registration process is configured for both moderation (admin
approval) and e-mail verification, then the order in which these occur can
be set. Verification can be required before approval, after approval, or
at any time before or after. The admin can override the order and cause
one or the other process to occur at any time.

  - Error checking of registration and user account fields has been improved and unified.

  - All user names and e-mail addresses are now stored in (and thus
displayed in) lower case.

  - New user names are required to consist of only letters, numbers,
underscores and periods. Accented and other non-ASCII characters are
permitted as long as their Unicode type is set to the letter or digit
group.

  - When retrieving user accounts (for any purpose, including for logging
in) by e-mail address, a duplicate e-mail address check is performed even
if the Users module is set to require unique e-mail addresses. This is to
prevent the wrong account from being returned if duplicate e-mail
addresses were allowed at any point or were added by the administrator.

  - A user with rights to delete user accounts is prevented from deleting
his own account.

  - The registration date, last login date, and all other dates saved to the database tables by the Users module are now guaranteed to be UTC
date/times in the database. They might be adjusted for display by other
functions, however.
