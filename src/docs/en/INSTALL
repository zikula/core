1. Zikula
=========

Zikula is an open source, open development application framework for dynamic
websites. The core system includes a complete API on which third party developments
can build. Zikula has a very strong community, which provides a large number of
extensions to the system and a helpful support centre in the forums.

2. Server Consideration
=======================
Before you begin, there are some requirements and guidelines you should consider
to make installing, running, and securing Zikula easier. Please read the Zikula
software recommendations document.

Zikula requires PHP 5.3.2 or greater and that `date.timezone` be set in the 
php.ini configuration file.  The minimum MySQL version is 5.1 and it is not 
recommended to install Zikula with MySQL STRICT mode enabled.

3. New Installation
===================
There are two installation methods for Zikula:

    a. Graphical Browser Install
       -------------------------
       To use the installer, simply visit install.php in the Zikula directory
       with your browser, e.g. `http://www.example.com/install.php`
       If you installed Zikula into a subdirectory 'foo' the URL would be
       `http://www.example.com/foo/install.php`

       The installer provides you with instructions on the way. Zikula require
       a database to be created at some point and it can save problems later if
       this is created by you before the install script is run. While it is
       possible for the Zikula installer to attempt to create the database,
       this will not always be successful as you will require greater access
       rights to the database. In most hosted environments this is not available
       so you must create databases through an administration control panel.
       If you do this, note down the database name, username and password for
       use in the installation.

       Once the installation process is complete, you can visit your Zikula
       website by navigating to index.php, e.g. `http://www.example.com/index.php`
       In the vast majority of cases, this will open automatically when typing
       `http://www.example.com/` into your browser.

    b. Manual SQL Dump Install (Not recommended)
       -----------------------------------------
       If you wish to import the SQL dump to install Zikula manually, this can
       be done through a tool such as phpMyAdmin. The dump provided is from a
       MySQL 5.x database, and may not work with other databases, or MySQL
       versions. Once you have imported the SQL dump, you should manually edit
       config/config.php and add the appropriate database connection details in
       the area reserved for the 'default' connection. Should you install in
       this manner, the administration login username is "admin" with password
       "Password" (without the quotes).

4. Final Note
=============
Modifications to the Zikula core system code or database are not supported. Doing
so can cause extensive problems when upgrading the system in the future and
therefore these 'hacks' are not recommended. Zikula has a flexible extensions
system and configuration override system to allow customization and we recommend
you consult the developer documentation about this.
