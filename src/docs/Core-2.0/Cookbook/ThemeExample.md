Creating a Theme based on ZikulaBootstrapTheme
==============================================

If you want to create your own theme, the starting point of reusing the ZikulaBoostrapTheme is a good idea. This 
example is based on the ZikulaBoostrapTheme of Zikula 1.4.5

* First create a new vendor folder inside the themes folder. It should start with a capital letter. For our 
example we should start with `Company`
* In this folder we will now create a theme folder. Let us name it `Paula`. So we now have the following: 
`themes/Company/Paula`.
* Copy all the files and folder of the folder ZikulaBootstrapTheme into the folder `Paula`.
* Rename `Company/Paula/ZikulaBootstrapTheme.php` to `Company/Paula/CompanyPaulaTheme.php`
* Change the content as follows:

```php
namespace Company\PaulaTheme;

use Zikula\Bundle\CoreBundle\Bundle\AbstractCoreTheme;

class CompanyPaulaTheme extends AbstractCoreTheme
{
}
```
* next the ``composer.json`` file must be changed. It is also located inside the theme root. It should look like:
```json
{
    "name": "company/paula-theme",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Our fancy Bootstrap based theme",
    "type": "zikula-theme",
    "license": "LGPL-3.0+",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Company",
            "homepage": "http://company.tld/"
        }
    ],
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": { "Company\\PaulaTheme\\": "" }
    },
    "require": {
        "php": ">=5.4.1"
    },
    "extra": {
        "zikula" : {
            "core-compatibility": ">=1.4.5",
            "class": "Company\\PaulaTheme\\CompanyPaulaTheme",
            "displayname": "Paula",
            "capabilities": {
                "user": true,
                "admin": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```
* the `theme/Company/Paula/Resources/config/overrides.yml` needs to update the paths. Otherwise the theme 
would use the overrides of the original ZikulaBootstrapTheme
* in `home.html.twig`, `master.html.twig` and `admin.html.twig` you have to change all instance of `@ZikulaBoostrapTheme`
to `@CompanyPaulaTheme`. They are located in `theme/Company/Paula/Resources/views`
* Do the same in `header.html.twig` which is located in `theme/Company/Paula/Resources/views/include`
* next change `{{ knp_menu_render('ZikulaBootstrapTheme:AdminMenu:menu') }}` with 
`{{ knp_menu_render('CompanyPaulaTheme:AdminMenu:menu') }}`
* There is a file named `AdminMenu` in the `/Menu` directory. Inside this file you will find the namespace. You have to adjust
  this accordingly: `namespace Company\PaulaTheme\Menu;`
* at the end you have to adjust the bootstrap css file. It is located inside `config/theme.yml`. Normally it looks 
like `bootstrapPath: themes/BootstrapTheme/Resources/public/css/cerulean.min.css`. It should get the right path:
`bootstrapPath: themes/Company/PaulaTheme/Resources/public/css/cerulean.min.css`

Now you should be able to activate your theme.
