Customizing Bootstrap
=====================

Changing the look of bootstrap is quite simple. 

* Please go to the site `http://getbootstrap.com/customize/` and configure what you need.
* Download your new customization
* Unpack your download locally
* You will find a file named `boostrap.min.css`
* Rename it to your needs (if you want) e.g. `paula.min.js`
* Copy the file into the css folder of your theme
* Now you have to make an adjustment within the file `theme.yml`. The line 
  `bootstrapPath: "@ZikulaBootstrapTheme:css/cerulean.min.css"` must be adjusted to the path where you
  have placed your new css file.
* It is wise to store the `config.json` which is delivered within the zip file somewhere in your theme. That makes it
  much easier to update the configuration again later.
