Events
======

CORE
----

#### `api.method_not_found`
Called in instances of Zikula_AbstractApi from __call()
Receives arguments from __call($method, argument) as $args
$event['method'] is the method which didn't exist in the main class.
$event['args'] is the arguments that were passed.
The event subject is the class where the method was not found.
Must exit if $event['method'] does not match whatever the handler expects.
Modify $event->data and $event->stopPropagation().

#### `core.preinit`
Occurs after the config.php is loaded.

#### `core.init`
Occurs after each `System::init()` stage, `$event['stage']` contains the stage.
To check if the handler should execute, do `if($event['stage'] & Zikula_Core::STAGE_*)`

#### `core.postinit`
Occurs just before System::init() exits from normal execution.

#### `controller.method_not_found`
Called in instances of `Zikula_AbstractController` from `__call()`
Receives arguments from `__call($method, argument)` as `$args`
`$event['method']` is the method which didn't exist in the main class.
`$event['args']` is the arguments that were passed.
The event subject is the class where the method was not found.
Must exit if `$event['method']` does not match whatever the handler expects.
Modify `$event->data` and `$event->stopPropagation()`

#### `dbobject.pre/post*`
Takes subject of $this.

MODULE
------

#### `installer.module.installed`
Called after a module is successfully installed.
Receives `$modinfo` as args

#### `installer.module.upgraded`
Called after a module is successfully upgraded.
Receives `$modinfo` as args

#### `installer.module.activated`
Called after a module is successfully activated.
Receives `$modinfo` as args

#### `installer.module.deactivated`
Called after a module is successfully deactivated.
Receives `$modinfo` as args

#### `installer.module.uninstalled`
Called after a module is successfully uninstalled.
Receives `$modinfo` as args

#### `installer.subscriberarea.uninstalled`
Called after a hook subscriber area is unregistered.
Receives args['areaid'] as the areaId.  Use this to remove orphan data associated with this area.


#### `module_dispatch.postloadgeneric`
receives the args `['modinfo' => $modinfo, 'type' => $type, 'force' => $force, 'api' => $api]`

#### `module_dispatch.preexecute`
Occurs in `ModUtil::exec()` before function call with the following args:
`['modname' => $modname, 'modfunc' => $modfunc, 'args' => $args, 'modinfo' => $modinfo, 'type' => $type, 'api' => $api]`

#### `module_dispatch.postexecute`
Occurs in `ModUtil::exec()` after function call with the following args:
`['modname' => $modname, 'modfunc' => $modfunc, 'args' => $args, 'modinfo' => $modinfo, 'type' => $type, 'api' => $api]`
receives the modules output with `$event->getData();`
can modify this output with `$event->setData($data);`

#### `module_dispatch.type_not_found`
if `$type` is not found in `ModUtil::exec()` (e.g. no admin.php)
_This is for classic module types only._
`['modname' => $modname, 'modfunc' => $modfunc, 'args' => $args, 'modinfo' => $modinfo, 'type' => $type, 'api' => $api]`
This kind of eventhandler should

1. Check $event['modfunc'] to see if it should run else exit silently.
2. Do something like $result = {$event['modfunc']}({$event['args'});
3. Save the result $event->setData($result).
4. $event->stopPropagation().
5. return void

#### `module_dispatch.custom_classname`
In order to override the classname calculated in `ModUtil::exec()`
In order to override a pre-existing controller/api method, use this event type to override the class name that is loaded.
This allows to override the methods using inheritance.
Receives no subject, args of `['modname' => $modname, 'modinfo' => $modinfo, 'type' => $type, 'api' => $api]`
and 'event data' of `$className`.  This can be altered by setting `$event->setData()` followed by `$event->stopPropagation()`

#### `module_dispatch.service_links`
Occurs when building admin menu items. Adds sublinks to a Services menu that is appended to all modules if populated.
triggered by module_dispatch.postexecute in bootstrap.
format data like so:

    $event->data[] = ['url' => ModUtil::url(<modname>, <type>, <method>), 'text' => __('Link Text')];

#### `module.mailer.api.sendmessage`
Invoked from `Mailer_Api_User#sendmessage`. Subject is `Mailer_Api_User` with `$args`.
This is a notifyUntil event so the event must `$event->stopPropagation()` and set any
return data into `$event->data`, or `$event->setData()`

#### `pageutil.addvar_filter`
Used to override things like system or module stylesheets or javascript.
Subject is the `$varname`, and `$event->data` an array of values to be modified by the filter.
Simply test with something like

    if (($key = array_search('system/Users/javascript/somescript.js', $event->data)) !== false) {
        $event->data[$key] = 'config/javascript/myoverride.js';
    }

This single filter can be used to override all css or js scripts or any other var types
sent to `PageUtil::addVar()`.


ERRORS
------
#### `system.outputfilter`
Filter type event for output filter HTML sanitisation

### THEME AND VIEW

#### `theme.ajax_request`
Triggered by a native ajax request from a theme.  This occurs when the following call is made
`ajax.php?module=theme&func=dispatch&.....`
Handlers should be registered in the theme.

#### `theme.preinit`
Occurs on the startup of the `Zikula_View_Theme#__construct()`.
The subject is the Zikula_View_Theme instance.
Is useful to setup a customized theme configuration or cache_id.

#### `theme.init`
Occurs just before `Zikula_View_Theme#__construct()` finishes.
The subject is the Zikula_View_Theme instance.

#### `theme.load_config`
Runs just before `Theme#load_config()` completed.  Subject is the Theme instance.

#### `theme.prefetch`
Occurs in `Theme::themefooter()` just before getting the `$maincontent`.  The
event subject is `$this` (Theme instance) and has $maincontent as the event data
which you can modify with `$event->setData()` in the event handler.

#### `theme.postfetch`
Occurs in `Theme::themefooter()` just after rendering the theme.  The
event subject is `$this` (Theme instance) and the event data is the rendered

#### `view.init`
Occurs just before `Zikula_View#__construct()` finishes.
The subject is the Zikula_View instance.

#### `view.postfetch`

#### `user.gettheme`
Called during UserUtil::getTheme() and is used to filter the results.  Receives arg['type']
with the type of result to be filtered and the $themeName in the $event->data which can
be modified.  Must $event->stopPropagation() if handler performs filter.

#### `module.users.ui.form_edit.mail_users_search`

A hook-like UI event triggered when the search form is displayed for sending e-mail messages to users. Allows other
