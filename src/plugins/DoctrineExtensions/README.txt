DOCTRINE EXTENSIONS
===================

Branch: 2.0.x

This plugin provides the DoctrineExtensions from https://github.com/l3pp4rd/DoctrineExtensions

Documentation is available at
https://github.com/l3pp4rd/DoctrineExtensions/tree/doctrine2.0.x/doc

The plugin simply adds the Gedmo namespace to the autoloaders so you
can just reference the classes without worrying about anything else.
