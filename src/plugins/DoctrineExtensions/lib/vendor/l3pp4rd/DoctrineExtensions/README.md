- Sluggable was refactored with a **BC break** for the sake of simplicity it now uses a single @Slug annotation.
Also there were slug handlers introduced for extended sluggable functionality, like path based
or relation based slugs. See the [documentation](https://github.com/l3pp4rd/DoctrineExtensions/blob/master/doc/sluggable.md)

### Summary and features

This package contains extensions for Doctrine2 that hook into the facilities of Doctrine and
offer new functionality or tools to use Doctrine2 more efficently. This package contains mostly
used behaviors which can be easily attached to your event system of Doctrine2 and handle the
records being flushed in the behavioral way. List of extensions:

- Tree - this extension automates the tree handling process and adds some tree specific functions on repository. (closure or nestedset)
- Translatable - gives you a very handy solution for translating records into diferent languages. Easy to setup, easier to use.
- Sluggable - urlizes your specified fields into single unique slug
- Timestampable - updates date fields on create, update and even property change.
- Loggable - helps tracking changes and history of objects, also supports version managment.
- Sortable - makes any document or entity sortable

Currently these extensions support **Yaml**, **Annotation**  and **Xml** mapping. Additional mapping drivers
can be easily implemented using Mapping extension to handle the additional metadata mapping.

**Note:** Please note, that xml mapping needs to be in a different namespace, the declared namespace for
Doctrine extensions is http://gediminasm.org/schemas/orm/doctrine-extensions-mapping
So root node now looks like this:

**Note:** Use 2.1.x tag in order to use extensions based on Doctrine2.1.x versions. Currently
master branch is based on 2.2.x versions and may not work with 2.1.x

```
<doctrine-mapping xmlns="http://doctrine-project.org/schemas/orm/doctrine-mapping"
                 xmlns:gedmo="http://gediminasm.org/schemas/orm/doctrine-extensions-mapping">
...
</doctrine-mapping>
```

**Notice:** extension tutorial on doctrine blog is outdated, most recent documentation is in **doc** directory.
There is a post introducing to these extensions on [doctrine project](http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/doctrine2-behavioral-extensions "Doctrine2 behavior extensions")

You can test these extensions on [my blog](http://gediminasm.org/test/ "Test doctrine behavior extensions").

All tutorials for basic usage examples are on [my blog](http://gediminasm.org "Tutorials for extensions") also.

### Running the tests:

PHPUnit 3.5 or newer is required.
To setup and run tests follow these steps:

- go to the root directory of extensions
- run: **php bin/vendors.php**
- run: **phpunit -c tests**
- optional - run mongodb in background to complete all tests
