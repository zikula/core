What Are Hooks?
===============
 - Hooks are events that are dynamically attached to listeners at runtime.
 - Hooks are connected to listeners in a User Interface and stored in a DB table.
 - Hooks are generically contracted for workflow types.

How are Hooks different from Events?
------------------------------------
 - Events are connected to listeners using EventListeners or EventSubscribers and
   cannot be dynamically assigned at will via a UI.
 - Events are uniquely contractural and specific to a single workflow.
