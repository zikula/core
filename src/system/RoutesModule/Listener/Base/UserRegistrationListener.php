    /**
     * Listener for the `module.users.ui.registration.succeeded` event.
     *
     * Occurs after a user has successfully registered a new account in the system. It will follow either a `user.registration.create`
     * event, or a `user.account.create` event, depending on the result of the registration process, the information provided by the user,
     * and several configuration options set in the Users module. The resultant record might
     * be a fully activated user record, or it might be a registration record pending approval, e-mail verification,
     * or both.
     *
     * If the registration record is a fully activated user, and the Users module is configured for automatic log-in,
     * then the system's next step (without any interaction from the user) will be the log-in process. All the customary
     * events that might fire during the log-in process could be fired at this point, including (but not limited to)
     * `module.users.ui.login.veto` (which might result in the user having to perform some action in order to proceed with the 
     * log-in process), `module.users.ui.login.succeeded`, and/or `module.users.ui.login.failed`.
     *
     * The event's subject is set to the registration record (which might be a full user record).
     * The event's arguments are as follows:
     *     `'returnurl'` A URL to which the user is redirected at the very end of the registration process.
     *
     * __The `'redirecturl'` argument__ controls where the user will be directed at the end of the registration process.
     * Initially, it will be blank, indicating that the default action should be taken. The default action depends on two
     * things: first, whether the result of the registration process is a registration request record or is a full user record,
     * and second, if the record is a full user record then whether automatic log-in is enabled or not.
     *
     * If the result of the registration process is a registration request record, then the default action is to direct the
     * user to a status display screen that informs him that the registration process has been completed, and also tells 
     * him what next steps are required in order to convert that request into a full user record. (The steps to be
     * taken may be out of the user's control--for example, the administrator must approve the request. The steps to
     * be taken might be within the user's control--for example, the user must verify his e-mail address. The steps might
     * be some combination of both within and outside the user's control.
     *
     * If the result of the registration process is a full user record, then one of two actions will happen by default. Either 
     * the user will be directed to the log-in screen, or the user will be automatically logged in. Which of these two occurs
     * is dependent on a module variable setting in the Users module. During the login process, one or more additional events may
     * fire.
     *
     * If a `'redirecturl'` is specified by any entity intercepting and processing the `module.users.ui.registration.succeeded` event, then
     * how that redirect URL is handled depends on whether the registration process produced a registration request or a full user
     * account record, and if a full user account record was produced then it depends on whether automatic log-in is enabled or 
     * not.
     *
     * If the result of the registration process is a registration request record, then by specifying a redirect URL on the event
     * the default action will be overridden, and the user will be redirected to the specified URL at the end of the process.
     *
     * If the result of the registration process is a full user account record and automatic log-in is disabled, then by specifying
     * a redirect URL on the event the default action will be overridden, and the user will be redirected to the specified URL at
     * the end of the process.
     *
     * If the result of the registration process is a full user account record and automatic log-in is enabled, then the user is
     * directed automatically into the log-in process. A redirect URL specified on the event will be passed to the log-in process
     * as the default redirect URL to be used at the end of the log-in process. Note that the user has NOT been automatically 
     * redirected to the URL specified on the event. Also note that the log-in process issues its own events, and any one of them
     * could direct the user away from the log-in process and ultimately from the URL specified in this event. Note especially that
     * the log-in process issues its own `module.users.ui.login.succeeded` event that includes the opportunity to set a redirect URL.
     * The URL specified on this event, as mentioned previously, is passed to the log-in process as the default redirect URL, and
     * therefore is offered on the `module.users.ui.login.succeeded` event as the default. Any handler of that event, however, has
     * the opportunity to change the redirect URL offered. A `module.users.ui.registration.succeeded` handler can reliably predict 
     * whether the user will be directed into the log-in process automatically by inspecting the Users module variable 
     * `Users_Constant::MODVAR_REGISTRATION_AUTO_LOGIN` (which evaluates to `'reg_autologin'`), and by inspecting the `'activated'`
     * status of the registration or user object received.
     *
     * An event handler should carefully consider whether changing the `'redirecturl'` argument is appropriate. First, the user may 
     * be expecting to return to the log-in screen . Being redirected to a different page might be disorienting to the user. Second, 
     * all event handlers are being notified of this event. This is not a `notify()` event. An event handler that was notified 
     * prior to the current handler may already have changed the `'redirecturl'`.
     *
     * @param GenericEvent $event The event instance.
