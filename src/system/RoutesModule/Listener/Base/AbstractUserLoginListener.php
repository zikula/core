     * A handler that needs to veto a login attempt should call `stopPropagation()`. This will prevent other handlers
     * from receiving the event, will return to the login process, and will prevent the login from taking place.

     * feedback to the user attempting to log in that might be appropriate.

     * Any attempt to check a user's permissions, his logged-in status, or any operation will
     * return a value equivalent to what an anonymous (guest) user would see.
     * Care should be taken to ensure that sensitive operations done within a handler for this event
     * do not introduce breaches of security.

     * If a `'redirecturl'` is specified by any entity intercepting and processing the `module.users.ui.login.succeeded` event, then
