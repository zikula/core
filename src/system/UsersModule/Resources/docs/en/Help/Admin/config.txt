Users Module Configuration
==========================

This page is used to configure the Users module, allowing the site administrator
to control how the module handles various aspects of its functions and features.

General settings
----------------
These settings affect the overall behavior of the Users module, or functions of
the module that do not fall into a specific category.

### _Name displayed for anonymous user_
Default: Guest

An 'anonymous' user is a web site visitor that has not logged in. This setting
establishes the display name used when a user name is requested for an
anonymous user.

### _Number of items displayed per page_
Default: 25

This setting controls the maximum number of records or items in a list displayed
on a page. If more than this number of records or items are available to be
displayed, then a "pager" will appear at the bottom of the list allowing the
user to navigate through the list.


Account page settings
---------------------
When a user who is logged in clicks on the "My Account" menu option, the "user
account page" is displayed. This page contains links (typically represented by
a series of icons) to user-specific functions made available by modules installed
in the system. These settings control the behavior of that page.

### _Display graphics on user's account page_
Default: Yes

The user account page can consist of a series of icons with text linking to
user-specific functions, or of a series of text-only links to those functions.
This setting controls which of those options is in effect.

### _Path to account page images_
Default: images/menu

The path to the images used on the user account page. If a relative path is given,
it is relative to the Zikula base directory.

### _Number of links per page_
Default: 25

The maximum number of user account page links to display on one page. If there
are more than this number of links to be displayed, a "pager" is displayed to
the user, allowing him to navigate through the list of links.

### _Number of links per row_
Default: 5

The number of links on a single row of the user account page, before a new row
is started.

### _Users module handles e-mail address maintenance_
Default: Yes

During the process of registering a new user, an e-mail address is collected from
and stored by the Users module. Typically, this e-mail address is maintained by
the Users module, ensuring that a valid, verified e-mail address is available
for the user. Some third-party modules, usually "profile" modules, also manage
the user's e-mail address. If such a module is installed, then this option can
be set to 'No', allowing the third-party module to manage the address. If this
option is set to 'Yes', then an "E-mail address manager" link is displayed on
the user account page, allowing the user to change his e-mail address using the
Users module function, which performs a verification of the address if the
'_Verify e-mail address during registration_' option is set to 'Yes.'


User credential settings
------------------------
These options control various aspects of how the user logs into the system and
how his account credentials are managed.

### _Credential required for user log-in_
Default: User name

This option controls the information a user must enter in order to log into the
web site. The options are:

 * _User name_: The user must enter his user name and password in order to log
   into the site.
 * _E-mail address_: The user must enter his e-mail address and password in order
   to log into the site.
 * _Either user name or e-mail address_: The user is presented with the choice
   of either entering his user name and password, or his e-mail address and
   password.

If this option is set to '_E-mail address_' or to '_Either user name or e-mail
address_', then the '_New e-mail addresses must be unique_' option (see below)
must be set to 'Yes'. This is to prevent two separate user accounts from
registering the same e-mail address, thus making the e-mail address point to two
different accounts. If this option is changed after the system has been operating
for some time with the '_New e-mail addresses must be unique_' option set to 'No'
then it is possible that an e-mail address may have been used for more than one
account. If that is the case, then the users associated with those accounts will
not be able to log into the site with their e-mail address.

This option controls only the two log-in methods (or "authentication methods")
defined by the Users module. If additional authentication modules (third-party
modules that follow the authentication API, and are used to log users into the
system) are installed, then the log-in methods that they provide will be displayed
to the user along with the method(s) controlled by this option.

### _New e-mail addresses must be unique_
Default: Yes

Setting this option to 'Yes' forces an e-mail address associated with a user
account to be unique. That is, no user account can be created with an e-mail
address already in use by another user account, and likewise no existing user
account can change its e-mail address to that of one already in use by another
user account.

Setting this option to 'Yes' can discourage a person from registering more than
one user account (but cannot prevent it, if the person has access to more than
one e-mail address).

This option must be set to 'Yes' if using an e-mail address to log into the site
is an option for your users. If a particular e-mail address is associated with
more than one user account record, then those users would not be able to log
into the site using that address.

This affects both new user registrations, and existing users who change the
e-mail address associated with their account (assuming that the Users module
is set to manage e-mail addresses). If a third-party module, such as a "profile"
module, is installed and is used to manage a user's e-mail address, then the
site administrator should ensure that the third-party module honors this setting
or otherwise prevents the same e-mail address from being associated with two
user accounts.

### _Minimum length for user passwords_
Default: 5

Passwords for user accounts set during new account registration or set during
a password change request must be at least this number of characters long to
be accepted.

### _Password hashing method_
Default: SHA256

Passwords are not stored directly by the Users module, but instead are (salted
and) hashed, and this hashed value is stored. When a user attempts to log into
the site, the password entered is hashed and then compared to the stored hash
value to determine if an acceptable value was entered. This setting controls the
algorithm used to create the hash value. The possible values are 'SHA256' and
'SHA1'. 'SHA256' is the more secure choice, and should be used unless there is
a compelling reason to use 'SHA1.'

If this option is changed after one or more users have created passwords, then
the hash values are updated to the new algorithm silently when the user next
logs into the system.

### _Show password strength meter_
Default: No

On pages where a user has the opportunity to create or change his account
password, this option controls whether the strength of the user's new password
is shown in the form of a password strength meter. The password strength meter
is JavaScript-based, therefore if the user's browser has JavaScript disabled,
then the meter will not be displayed, despite this option's setting.

### _E-mail address verifications expire in_
Default: 0 (e-mail verification requests do not expire)

When a user changes his e-mail address, the user is asked to verify the new
e-mail address. This option controls how long the e-mail verification code sent
via e-mail to the user is valid. A value of zero (0) means that the verification
code never expires. A positive integer indicates that the verification code is
valid for that number of days. For example, a value of 180 indicates that the
verification code is valid for 180 days, or approximately 6 months.

When an e-mail address verification code expires the record of the e-mail
address change request is deleted, and the e-mail address associated with the
user's account is not changed. (If the user verifies his e-mail address prior to
the expiration of the code, then the e-mail address is changed and the request
record is removed.)

### _Password reset requests expire in_
Default: 0 (password reset requests do not expire)

When a user requests to change the password on his account (assuming he has a
password, and has not registered with a non-User module authentication method),
he is sent a verification code via e-mail. This verification code must be used
in order to change the password on the account. This option controls how long
the code is valid before the request to change the account password expires.  A
value of zero (0) means that the verification code never expires. A positive
integer indicates that the verification code is valid for that number of days.
For example, a value of 180 indicates that the verification code is valid for
180 days, or approximately 6 months.

When a passowrd change request verification code expires the record of the
password change request is deleted, and the password associated with the user's
account is not changed. (If the user enters the verification code prior to its
expiration, then user is permitted to change the account password, and the request
record is removed.)


Registration settings
---------------------
These options control how a new user requests a new user account on the site.

### _Allow new user account registrations_
Default: Yes

Controls whether new users can request new user accounts at all on the system.

For a private or semi-private web site, this option can be set to 'No,' and the
site administrator(s) can create new user accounts through the Users module
administration page.

This option can also be set to 'No' to temporarily disable new user registration
for any reason the site's administrator or owner determines.

### _Statement displayed if registration disabled_
_**Note:** If JavaScript is enabled on your browser, then this option is only
displayed if the 'Allow new user account registrations' option is set to 'No.'
This option is ignored if 'Allow new user account registrations' is set to 'Yes.'_

Default: Sorry! New user registration is currently disabled.

When new user registration is disabled, a message is displayed to any user who
attempts to access the registration process. The text of this option is the
message that is displayed.

### _E-mail address to notify of registrations_
Default: (_blank, no notification e-mail is sent_)

If the administrator wishes to be notified of each new request for a new user
account, then an e-mail address can be entered here. Every time a new user
registration request is made an e-mail is sent to the address.

_Tip_: To send an e-mail message to more than one person, set the address in this
option to a group alias or mailing list managed by the e-mail server.

### _User registration is moderated_
Default: No

Controls whether new user accounts must be approved by a site administrator prior
to becoming full user account records.

If this option is set to 'Yes,' then registration requests will appear on the
"Pending registrations" list available on the Users module administration page.
Site administrators may approve (or deny) pending registration requests from
that list.

If e-mail addresses must be verified during registration, and the user has not
yet verified his e-mail address, then the registration request will remain on
the pending list. If the user has verified his e-mail address, or e-mail
verification is not required at all, then the user registration request is
converted to a full user account record immediately upon approval.

### _Verify e-mail address during registration_
Default: Yes. User chooses password, then activates account via e-mail

Controls whether a user requesting a new user account through the registration
process must verify his e-mail address. If set to 'Yes,' then following the
submission of a registration request the user is sent an e-mail with a
verification code. The user must enter this code on the page whose link is
provided in the e-mail message in order to verify his address.

If the '_Order that approval and verification occur_' option is set to
'Registration applications must be approved before users verify their e-mail
address,' then the verification e-mail is not sent immediately, but is instead
sent after the registration request is approved.

### _Order that approval and verification occur_
_**Note:** If JavaScript is enabled on your browser, then this option is only
displayed if both the 'User registration is moderated' option  and the 'Verify
e-mail address during registration' option are set to 'Yes.' This option is
ignored if either the the 'User registration is moderated' option or the 'Verify
e-mail address during registration' option are set to 'No.'_

Default: Registration applications must be approved before users verify their
e-mail address.

Controls the order in which registration moderation (approval) and e-mail
verification occur.

If the option is set to '_Registration applications must be approved before
users verify their e-mail address_,' then a site administrator must first
approve the registration request. Once approved, then an e-mail verification
message is sent to the user containing a code that must be entered on the page
whose address is supplied in the message.

If the option is set to '_Users must verify their e-mail address before their
application is approved_,' then an e-mail verification message is immediately
sent to the user containing a code that must be entered on the page whose
address is supplied in the message. A site administrator cannot approve the
registration request (without overriding this option, which is also possible)
until the verification process is complete.

If the option is set to '_Application approval and e-mail address verification
can occur in any order_,' then the verification message is sent to the user
immediately, and the registration request can also be approved immediately. The
registration request is only converted to a full user record when both the
verification process and the approval process are completed.

### _Log in new registrations automatically?_
_**Note:** If JavaScript is enabled on your browser, then this option is only
displayed if both the 'User registration is moderated' option  and the 'Verify
e-mail address during registration' option are set to 'No.' This option is
ignored if either the the 'User registration is moderated' option or the 'Verify
e-mail address during registration' option are set to 'Yes.'_

Default: Newly registered users are not logged in automatically.

If neither e-mail address verification nor moderation are required for
registration, then a registration request results in a full user account.
Because the user has a full user account and has just created a password (or
has authenticated through some third-party authentication module), then asking
the user to log into the site at the end of the registration process might seem
redundant.

If set to 'Newly registered users are logged in automatically,' then the user
is automatically sent into the log-in process at the completion of the
registration process. The credentials supplied during the registration process
are passed to the log-in process as if the user had typed them into the normal
log-in page, and the user proceeds through the full log-in process complete with
all events that might be generated by that process.

### _Registrations pending verification expire in_
_**Note:** This option is ignored if 'Verify e-mail address during registration'
is set to 'No.'_

Default: 0 (registration requests do not expire)

This option controls how long a registration request awaiting e-mail address
verification will remain valid. If the verification process is not complete
before the expiration, then the entire registration request record is removed
from the system.

A value of zero (0) indicates that registration requests awaiting e-mail
verification never expire. A positive integer indicates that the registration
request is valid for that number of days. For example, a value of 180 indicates
that the registration request is valid for 180 days, or approximately 6 months.

The expiration period does not commence until an e-mail address verification
message is actually sent to the user. If the '_Order that approval and
verification occur_' option is set to 'Registration applications must be
approved before users verify their e-mail address,' then the expiration period
will begin only _after_ the registration request is approved and an e-mail
verification message is sent.

### _Spam protection question_
Default: (_blank, no spam protection question is asked_)

To protect a site, especially one not requiring approval or e-mail verification,
from "bots" or other non-human sources of spam, a question can be asked as part
of the registration process. The question asked should have a simple and
well-known answer that is unambiguous and easy for a human to answer, but
extremely difficult or impossible for a computer to answer.

If this option is blank, then no spam protection question is asked of the user
during registration.

Multi-language features are not enabled for this option, so if your site supports
more than one language, the question should be easy enough for all of your
visitors to answer.

### _Reserved user names_
Default: root, webmaster, admin, administrator, nobody, anonymous, username

This option contains a comma-separated list of user names that cannot be chosen
by new users at the time of registration.

### _Banned user agents_
Default: (_blank, no banned agents_)

To provide additional protection against registration by automated sources of
spam, "user agents" or browser identification strings can be banned from the
registration process. Each browser identifies itself to the web server it is
visiting with a user agent identification string.

To ban a particular user agent enter enough of the identification string to be
unique, starting from the beginning of the string. To ban more than one agent,
separate each string fragment with a comma. The strings entered in this option
are matched to the beginning part of the user agent identification string
reported by the visiting browser. If the beginning part of the identification
string matches one in this list then it is prevented from entering the
registration process.

_**Note:**_ It is very easy to spoof (report a fake) user agent string, making
a bot or other undesirable browser seem to the server as if it were one that was
desirable. This option is less effective in preventing undesirable registrants
than it has been in the past.

### _Banned e-mail address domains_
Default: (_blank, no banned domains_)

Some site administrators or owners might want to prevent users from registering
with e-mail addresses from specific domains. The domain portion of an e-mail
address is that which follows (and does not include) the '@' symbol. Enter banned
e-mail address domains in this option, separating each one by a comma.

_**Note:**_ In the past it was common to attempt to prevent spam by banning users
with so-called "free" e-mail accounts from registering with web sites. More
recently, these e-mail address domains are in common use by many users that sites
would consider legitimate and desirable users. Banning these types of "free"
e-mail accounts from the registration process is no longer as effective in
preventing spam as it had been in the past. Moreover, some potential users of
your site may have one of these e-mail addresses as their only e-mail account.


User log-in settings
--------------------
These options control aspects of the log-in process.

### _WCAG-compliant log-in and log-out_
Default: Yes

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines][wcag] (WCAG) dictate that the use of a meta tag in
the head section of a web page with an http-equiv value of "refresh" and a value
representing seconds greater than zero (0) fails to meet accessibility standards.
In Zikula's predecessor, PostNuke, it was common to have a "landing page" appear
briefly after a successful log-in attempt, telling the user that he had
successfully logged into the system and then redirecting him through the use of
this meta refresh function to the site's home page (or some other appropriate
page). A similar landing page with a meta refresh was displayed after a
successful log-out.

Because this does not meet accessibility guidelines, Zikula defaults to a
WCAG-compliant process of simply redirecting the user to the appropriate page
without an intermediate landing page.

Site's wishing to disregard accessibility guidelines and restore this behavior
can do so by setting this option to 'No.'

### _Failed login displays inactive status_
Default: No. A generic error message is displayed.

After a failed attempt at logging into a site it is common to provide a generic
error message suggesting that the credentials supplied were not valid or not
found in the system.

If a user with a valid set of credentials (e.g., a user name and a password)
cannot log in because a site administrator has marked his account as inactive,
then with this option set to 'No,' the user will receive the generic error
message when his attempt to log in fails.

If a site wishes to indicate that the reason for the failed log-in attempt is
because the user's account is marked inactive, then set this option to 'Yes,' and
this more specific message will be displayed to the user instead of the generic
message.

### _Failed login displays verification status_
Default: No. A generic error message is displayed.

After a failed attempt at logging into a site it is common to provide a generic
error message suggesting that the credentials supplied were not valid or not
found in the system.

If a user who recently registered with the site but who has not completed the
e-mail address verification process attempts to log into the site with an
otherwise valid set of credentials (e.g., a user name and a password),
then with this option set to 'No,' the user will receive the generic error
message when his attempt to log in fails.

If a site wishes to indicate that the reason for the failed log-in attempt is
because the user's registration request is still waiting for the verification
process to be completed, then set this option to 'Yes,' and this more specific
message will be displayed to the user instead of the generic message.

### _Failed login displays approval status_
Default: No. A generic error message is displayed.

After a failed attempt at logging into a site it is common to provide a generic
error message suggesting that the credentials supplied were not valid or not
found in the system.

If a user who recently registered with the site but whose registration request
has not yet been approved by a site administrator attempts to log into the site
with an otherwise valid set of credentials (e.g., a user name and a password),
then with this option set to 'No,' the user will receive the generic error
message when his attempt to log in fails.

If a site wishes to indicate that the reason for the failed log-in attempt is
because the user's registration request is still waiting for administrator
approval, then set this option to 'Yes,' and this more specific message will be
displayed to the user instead of the generic message.
