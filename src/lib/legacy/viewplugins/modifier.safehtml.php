/**
 * Zikula_View modifier to prepare variable for display, preserving some HTML tags
 *
 * This modifier carries out suitable escaping of characters such that when output
 * as part of an HTML page the exact string is displayed, except for a number of
 * admin-defined HTML tags which are left as-is for display purposes.
 *
 * This modifier should be used with great care, as it does allow certain
 * HTML tags to be displayed.
 *
 * The HTML tags that will be displayed are those defined in the configuration
 * variable AllowableHTML , which is set on a per-instance basis by the site administrator.
 *
 * Running this modifier multiple times is cumulative and is not reversible.
 * It recommended that variables that have been returned from this modifier
 * are only used to display the results, and then discarded.
 *
 * Example
 *
 *   {$myVar|safehtml}
 *
 * @param mixed $string The contents to transform
 *
 * @see    modifier.safehtml.php::smarty_modifier_DataUtil::formatForDisplay()
 *
 * @return string The modified output
